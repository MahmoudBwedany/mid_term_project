Hello team,

our website tells about our services,our skills etc.

here is our parts;
Hey TeamMates, 
We're going to use bootstratb, and of course our work will go through github so we have an easy way to share our code. 

We've divided the page into sections and assigned each one to a team member. 

We also assigned lines in index for each person, so we can minimize the conflicts while merging:
Eren will have lines from 0 to 2000 
Mahmoud will have from 2000 to 4000
Ruya will have from 4000 to 6000 
Razan will have from 6000 to 8000 

Don't worry that your lines don't match the right place in the homepage, will get to that at the end of the project. 

We're going to help each other and comunicate through the slack channel called team_e. 
Let's do this


VERY IMPORTANT POINTS;
    1-don't forget to name IDs or class names
    2-name your style.css in different names like aboutus.css, contact.css
    3-don't forget to create branches and add commits
